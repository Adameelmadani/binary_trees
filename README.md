## About

This project provides a set of C programs and modules for working with binary trees. It is designed as an educational resource to understand how binary trees work, how to manipulate them, and how they can be used to solve various problems. The codebase includes implementations for basic and advanced tree algorithms.

## Features

- Create and delete binary trees
- Insert and remove nodes
- Traverse trees (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order)
- Calculate tree properties (height, depth, size, leaf count, etc.)
- Check if a tree is balanced, full, perfect, or a BST
- Find ancestors, siblings, and uncles
- Implementations for binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and heaps (if included)

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Binary Trees**
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
- **AVL Trees** (if available)
- **Heaps** (if available)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or any C99-compatible compiler

### Compiling

You can compile the project using `gcc`:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 *.c -o binary_trees
```

## Usage

Example usage (assuming a main program is provided):

```sh
./binary_trees
```

You can also include and use the provided header files in your own C projects:

```c
#include "binary_trees.h"
```

## Project Structure

- `binary_trees.h` – Header file with data structure definitions and function prototypes
- `*.c` – Source files implementing tree operations and utilities
- `main.c` – Example main program
